 ## Description: 

In this project, local storage is used to read, retrieve and save tasks. Task cards are created with createTaskCard function which appends a despcription, due date, delete button, header and body and uses user inputs for information within the card. The generateTaskId function creates a unique id for each task card. RenderTaskList reads the tasks from local storage and appends them into the correct task lane based on their status.
The .draggable function allows the cards to be dragged accross lanes while the .droppable allows them to be dropped into lanes(unable to have this functioning). handleAddTask also takes the information from the users inputs from each part of the modal to make a new task. handleDeleteTask is used for deleting the tasks by using .filter to create an array excluding that particular task.


Unable to accomplish:
Making Cards droppbable to other lanes.
